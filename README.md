This is just a PoC that I used to test mushspace. The idea was to "finish"
mushspace, convert this to Rust, and then build up towards a full-fledged
Funge-98 (Unefunge-98, Befunge-98, Trefunge-98) interpreter. But things got
stalled at the first step and at this point I'm unlikely to find the
time/interest to get it done. I figured I'd put this up anyway in case
someone's interested in mushspace and can't see the forest for the trees.
